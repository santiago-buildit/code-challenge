## üìê Architecture

The solution is designed for deployment on AWS. It consists of a frontend built with Vue and TypeScript, and a backend developed in Go with the Gin framework. Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. The backend API is served in a serverless mode. Infrastracture as Code is implemented using Terraform.

The following diagram illustrates the main components and their distribution across AWS services:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build & Deploy

To build and deploy the solution, some development tools must be installed as prerequisites.

Additionally, the infra/terraform.tfvars.example file should be copied to terraform.tfvars, and the desired values assigned to its properties. In particular, the project_name property concatenated with a dash (-) is used as a name prefix for all AWS resources to be created.

Once the properties are configured and the required tools are installed, build and deployment tasks can be executed using the Makefile. The available targets are documented below.

### Prerequisites

- Go (>= 1.20)
- Node.js + npm
- Terraform (>= 1.3)
- AWS CLI configured
- Swag (for Swagger docs)

### Make Targets

## üìå Final Considerations

The solution aims to showcase a maintainable code structure for both frontend and backend, incorporating infrastructure as code to simplify resources management.

From a functional perspective, usability was prioritized over code repetition. Book CRUD and Book Status Report requirements were unified into a single listing view, allowing filtered searches, sorting, and pagination‚Äîhandled by the backend API rather than the browser.

Following the same principle of avoiding repetition in this demonstration, a CRUD for Authors was not included.
